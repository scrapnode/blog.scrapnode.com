Today is Third Day of Lunar New Year in Viet Nam, so I think it is a good time to start my blog. There are many motivation to make me get start a blog, but the most wanted things I want to achieve are:

- Improve writing and speaking skills by write posts and record them
- Put my tricks somewhere I can find it easily
- Build up my brand by tell everybody who am I and what I have to deal with every day

## Writing and speaking, the most important soft-skill I have to accomplish

I have become Princial Engineer for 2 years and I realized I spent almost time to discuss with teams about their solutions and write down ticket description and documents as well. None of them are easy, they are complicated, not my favorite part in this industry and hard to do them good. I have tried to avoid them before but the more I stay away from them the more headache I got. So I decide to face to them, fight with them as a man and defeat them someday

## Place to archive my tricks

Developers are collecting their tricks year by year and end up with a lot of things to store. I am not an exception. I have a ton of tricks that help me solve common problems and I put them in many places: a main github repository, a note in notebook or just a message in Telegram. It is not only hard to maintain but also painful to search what I want. I need a place I can archive tricks, provide easy way to share them to friends and FREE. You can see the blog is the best option of those characteristics

## Tell everybody your problem, they will know who you are

The most interesting interview question I always ask interviewers is `What is the most difficult challenge did you solve before?`. I listened to their answer, asked them some questions and I would know who they are easily. If the most challenge you have solved before is just a simple CRUD that mean all of things you show off in your curriculum vitae are lies

By telling you what I am dealing with every day, what problem that take me some days to solve and which topics I am intersted in you can draw down a picture of me. Then you can recognize me quickly and know what I can offer to you.
