Today is the third day of Lunar New Year in Vietnam, and I think it is a good time to start my blog. There are many motivations to start a blog, but my most wanted things I want to achieve are:

- Improving my writing and speaking skills by writing posts and recording them.
- Storing my tricks in a place where I can easily access them.
- Building up my brand by telling everyone who I am and what I deal with on a daily basis.

## Writing and speaking, the most important soft-skill I have to accomplish

I have been a Principal Engineer for the past two years and I realized I spent almost all my time discussing with my team and writing ticket descriptions and documents. None of them are simple, they are complicated and not my favorite part in this industry. Despite my attempts to avoid them, the longer I avoided them, the more headaches I experienced. So I decided to face them, fight them, and someday I will defeat them.

## Place to archive my tricks

Developers, including myself, collect their tricks year by year and end up with a lot of things to store. I have amassed a multitude of tricks that aid me in solving common problems, and I put them in many places: a main github repository, a note in notebook or just a message in Telegram. It is not only difficult to maintain but also painful to search what I want. I need a place I can archive these tricks, make it easy to share with friends and most importantly, it must be FREE. You can see the blog is the best option that fits these criteria.

## Tell everybody your problem, they will know who you are

The most interesting interview question I always ask interviewers is `What is the most difficult challenge did you solve before?`. I listened to their answer, asked them some questions and I would know who they are easily. If the most challenge you have solved before is just a simple CRUD that mean all of things you show off in your curriculum vitae are lies.
By telling you what I am dealing with every day, what problem that take me some days to solve and which topics I am intersted in you can draw down a picture of me. Then you can recognize me quickly and know what I can offer to you.
