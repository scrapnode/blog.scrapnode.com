## Problem with Docker Registry

I have managed a [GitOps workflow](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) with Github Action and FluxCD for 2 years. Erverything is fine until Docker announced [new rate limit](https://www.docker.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-upcoming-docker-hub-rate-limiting/). There is the 2 important quotes:

- `For anonymous users, the rate limit is set to 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address`
- `For authenticated users, itâ€™s 200 pulls per 6 hour period`

Because FluxCD use pulling model that check new image by an interval time, my GitOps workflow will not worked anymore because of the rate limit of Docker. I need to find out a new solution that let CICD works well again

## Dead simple solution

The solution is simple - push docker image to 2 diffrent registries (Docker Registry and another reigstry that has larger rate limit). I wil, push the stable build (tag by semantic version) to Docker Registry so everybody can use it easily. For the another registry (I am using [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)), I can push the latest code with anything I want to test and FluxCD will deploy it for me without any issue

## Implementation

What we need here is 2 pipelines that run 2 different jobs to push 2 separate registry and some flags that let us know which pipline should be run (or we need to run both of them). Here is the architecture we need to accomplish

![multiple-registry-pipline](/assets/img/multiple-registry-pipline.png)

The `prepare` is the key step where we will check which pipline should we run (for example, I need to push image to DockerHub and ECR). The condition logic is simple:

- If we have set `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, enable pipeline that push image to Docker Hub
- If we have set `ECR_USERNAME`, enable ECR pipeline too
- If we have set something else, enable corresponding pipeline as well

{% raw %}
```yaml
prepare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
        ENABLED_ECR: ${{ steps.CHECK_ECR.outputs.ENABLED }}
        ENABLED_DOCKERHUB: ${{ steps.CHECK_DOCKERHUB.outputs.ENABLED }}
    steps:
        - id: CHECK_DOCKERHUB
        env:
            DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        if: "${{ env.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME != '' }}"
        run: echo "ENABLED=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

        - id: CHECK_ECR
        env:
            ECR_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ECR_USERNAME }}
        if: "${{ env.ECR_USERNAME != '' }}"
        run: echo "ENABLED=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```
{% endraw %}

In each pipeline, you need to add a condition to let the pipeline of enabled flag run or be skipped. With Github Action it is too simple with the `if` condition in each job

{% raw %}
```yaml
dockerhub:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [prepare]
    if: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.ENABLED_DOCKERHUB == 'true' }} # <- where you tell Github Action whether we we let it run or not
    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - ...
        
ecr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [prepare]
    if: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.ENABLED_ECR == 'true' }} # <- where you tell Github Action whether we we let it run or not
    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - ...
```
{% endraw %}

## Limitations

If we need to run too many pipelines (> 2 pipelines), you can find there is resource wasting at the workflow I have showed you. Because we need to run seperated job for different registry, we end up with run docker build multiple time. You can improve it by run only one job, set the flag to environment variable and check it at the step of push image to registry. But you can not reuse pre-defined actions from Github Actions Marketplace. 

In my case, they are [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) and [aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login)


> Be careful when you decided to manage credentials of registry by yourself cause there is a risk to leak them at Github Action logs

## Bonus

Full version of Github Action file is placed on my open source project. You can find it at [Scraphook - The fast, secure, and efficient webhook service ](https://github.com/scrapnode/scraphook/blob/master/.github/workflows/master.yaml)
